<h1 style="text-align: center; color: cyan">Who I Am</h1>

<p style="text-align: center; color: yellow">My name is Victoria.
   I am a dual major student IT at ACC in Cyber security,
   and Network Administration. I am a direct decendent of the 
   eldest member of the Takelma Tribe, and a soon-to-be member of the 
   <a href="www.ctsi.nsn.us" target="_blank">Confederate Tribes of Siletz Indians</a>
   in Siletz, Oregon. My Great Great Great Grandfather George Harney
   was the first, and only elected chief of the Confederated Tribes of Siletz.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center; color: cyan">Interests</h2>

<p style="text-align: center; color: yellow">I love reading. My favorite books are The Hitchhiker's Guide
   to the Galaxy, Ender's Game, and The Outsiders. I'm a video game lover. My favorite games are American
   McGee's Alice, Alice: Madness returns, World of Warcraft, and Star Wars: The Old Republic. 
   I am a huge Star Wars fan. I have a Shih-Tzu named Mookiee, which is Ewokeese for a female Wokling.</p>
